## 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hey there! I’m Manjunath, a third-year Computer Science Engineering student at UBDT College of Engineering, Davangere.
I’m deeply curious about how things work under the hood and love turning ideas into real, working software.

My journey in tech is driven by:

> solving real-world problems

> writing clean & efficient code

> and continuously leveling up my  skills

From cracking DSA problems to building backend-heavy projects, I believe consistency beats everything 🚀
